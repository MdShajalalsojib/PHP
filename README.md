# PHP — Introduction
PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a popular server-side scripting language used mainly for web development. It runs on the server and generates dynamic content that is sent to the user’s browser. PHP is widely used because it is easy to learn, works well with databases (like MySQL), and is supported by almost all web servers and hosting providers.

## With PHP, you can:
 - Create dynamic web pages
 - Handle forms and user input
 - Work with databases
 - Build login systems
 - Develop full websites and web applications
PHP scripts are written inside a file with the .php extension and executed on the server before the result is displayed as HTML.

## Basic Examples
 ```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>PHP Hello</title></head>
  <body>
    <?php
      echo "<h1>Hello, world!</h1>";
    ?>
  </body>
</html>
